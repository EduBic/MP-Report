\label{sec:conclusion} 
We can certainly say that Sweetie is a great didactic project. We have needed to learn a lot of android SDK content: Fragment, RecyclerView, ConstraintLayout, Bitmap, ToolBar are only some of classes that we need to learn to manage and use correctly. We also learn to use some powerful Google library that are essential for developing in Android.

We learn also some of the best practices in architecture design for Android. Model View Presenter is a great pattern although we didn't use all the advantages: the testing advantage in particular.

Nevertheless the issues leave open we are satisfied of this release and we are confident that this is the first step for a complete application that can reach the Play Store. Anyway this is only the beginning we should have to learn new components and library of Android for extending our knowledge.
